-Using mysql as my database  
-JPA for mysql connection  

## Fronted: ecommerce-frontend repository

### Currently working on
-Adjusting the service according to my frontend and overall ecommerce logic, like disallow duplicate address  
-Didn't thought the backend completley through before started coding it. Tweaking it according how the frontend demands the data. 

#### Todo
-Validate all DTOs. But for this I wait till the frontend is ready and corresponding to it needs I will validate data in backend.
-Not yet sure what will be needed in future, as this is my first approach to a backend.
